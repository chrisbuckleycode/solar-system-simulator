Simulation of planets orbiting the sun

## Problem Statement

It is difficult to understand and appreciate how celestial bodies interact, in particular those that orbit others (e.g. planets around a sun, moons around a planet).

## Requirements

- Use a library that can plot vector graphics. e.g. matplotlib (Math plotting library) or pygame (game library). Chose pygame for educational purposes, to discover it's rendering capabilities.
- For simplicity, fix largest body (sun) in center, with planets orbiting around. Ignore moons for now. Only three planets. Later can try an n-body simulation.
